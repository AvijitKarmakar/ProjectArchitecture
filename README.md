# ProjectArchitecture

This is a sample project of MVP architecture in Android and Java. Also, I have maintained the packaging structure by Package-by-Feature. 

In this project, I have used Dagger 2 for dependency injection which provides us to initialize the objects in a single place. Here, I have created a module and a component for each feature. Also, I have created an module for the full application which we need all over the project.

RxJava and RxAndroid are only used for doing REST API calls. It enables us to do Reactive Programming. This reactive programming is actually an extension of Observable and Observer pattern

Retrofit 2 for REST API calls and DataBinding to bind the application logic with the layouts.

If anybody wants to improve this project then, you are always welcome. If any issues, improvements needed then please create a topic in issues. We will discuss it there.

Thanks.
